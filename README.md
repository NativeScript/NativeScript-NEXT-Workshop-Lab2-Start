## What are we learning?

In this lab weâ€™re going to build upon the splash screen we built  in the first lab. Our overall goal here is to navigate to our home page, get and load some images, navigate to our next page. In doing so we will explore the following topics:

* Page navigation
* Page layout and structure
* Handling page events
* UI Controls
* Control Events
* Basic Modules
